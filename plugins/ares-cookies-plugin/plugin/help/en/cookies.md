# Cookies

Cookies are a fun way to appreciate your fellow players for playing with you.  Whereas some games use serious systems with nominations or votes, cookies are entirely frivolous.  Had fun?  Give a cookie.  Cookies are tallied and awarded weekly; you can only give someone a single cookie each week. 

Consult your game's policies to see if there's any use for cookies beyond the fun of recognizing others.

`cookie <list of names>` - Give a cookie.
`cookies/scene [<scene number>]` - Gives cookies to everyone in a scene (handy for big scenes, or if you forget to cookie before people start leaving).  You can leave off the scene number to use a scene you're in.
`cookies` - Sees cookies you have given out this week.
`cookies/total` - Shows how many cookies you've ever gotten.
